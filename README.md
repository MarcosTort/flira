### Usage


The <b>Flira report dialog </b> is built to be placed inside the home parameter of our <b>MaterialApp</b>.

Once we initialized the Flira client, we will be able to call the report dialog using three methods: 
- shaking the screen
- taking a screenshot or 
- calling to a void function from Flira package.
